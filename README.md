# Flight-data-analysis-using-Python-and-R
Produced an in-depth analysis of commercial flight delays, passenger travel habits and cascading delays between airports using both Python and R programming languages. Implemented a logistic regression learning algorithm using scikit-learn (sklearn) and Mlr3 to predict future flight delays in real world scenarios.
